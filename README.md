# fcc-productlandingpage
This is a Free Code Camp (FCC) related project in the web design module. The goal of this project was to create a landing page for a fictional product.

My fictional product is called Zoomtunes. It is a practice aid for musicians and is mostly geared towards percussionists or bass players.

## Project Description
This project involved several tasks.
1. Brainstorming the fictional product. To assist in the creative process, I established limitations: it would be an aid to enjoying music or practicing music, it would help the user keep time/bass/percussion/rhythm, it would be something that I would actually use, and it would involve machine learning. After playing around with many different names and concepts, I kept coming back to the word "Zoom" and the concept of being able to change tempo at will. Zoom and Tunes just happen to sound good together, and the rest of the features came easily once I had the product name. 
2. Researching design precedents. This task overlapped with #1, because I wanted the product concept to be visually communicated with bright colors and abstract shapes. I used Trello and Spotify as design precedents, and searched on Canva for website backgrounds; I found the current background on Canva. I designed the logo in Adobe Illustrator. Each circle in the logo is 15% smaller than the previous circle. It is intended to be reminiscent of a DJ setup or a vinyl record player. The color palette in the website was extracted from the background image.
3. Find a website precedent I could work from, because I didn't want to build this from scratch. This is the precedent I used:  https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL.
4. Set up a local environment - instead of building this on CodePen, I used Brackets. 
5. Build the thing.
6. Polish. For this project, I created a quality checklist in an effort to build good habits. This included checking that margin and padding properties were on a single line (rather than margin-top, margin-bottom, etc), eliminating any HTML <br> tags and modifying the CSS instead, cleaning up unused CSS classes. 

## Ideas to Improve
- Create product modals that display when specific tiers are selected
- For the app store icons, link to the actual app stores
- Add a display message when users submit their email address
- Testing responsiveness on phones, tablets, and different size screens.
